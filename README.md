# OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications

Welcome to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications repository! This project aims to identify and address the top security risks associated with large language model (LLM) AI applications. Your contributions and participation are vital to shaping a secure and robust future for LLM AI.

## Overview

The OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications is an evolving project designed to provide guidance and best practices for the secure development and deployment of LLM AI applications. This repository serves as the central hub for data collection, analysis, and the dissemination of our findings.

## Data Collection

We are currently collecting data for the 2024 edition of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM AI Applications. We invite you to contribute to this critical effort. The data collection period runs from May 20th to June 30th, 2024.

### Contribution Process

There are two main ways to contribute data:
1. Email a CSV/Excel/JSON file with the dataset(s) to [emmanuel.guilhermejunior@owasp.org](mailto:emmanuel.guilhermejunior@owasp.org).
2. Upload a CSV/Excel/JSON file to [hyperlink will be added here].

### Data Structure

We have provided CSV and JSON templates to standardize contributions. These templates include the following data elements:

- Contributor Name (organization or anonymous)
- Contributor Contact Email
- Time period (2023, 2022, 2021)
- *Number of applications tested
- *CWEs with the number of applications found in: MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATLAS, STRIDE, Cyclone DX SBOM
- Type of testing (TaH, HaT, Tools)
- Primary Language (code)
- Geographic Region (Global, North America, EU, Asia, other)
- Primary Industry (Multiple, Financial, Industrial, Software, etc.)
- Whether the data contains retests or the same applications multiple times (True/False)

Contributors with multiple datasets from different sources are recommended to submit them as separate datasets.

## Analysis

The data collected will be analyzed to support and validate our current and new entries, incorporating new LLM trends throughout the 2024 collection period.

## Timeline

- **Data Collection:** May 20th â€“ June 30th, 2024
- **Analysis:** July
- **Draft:** August/September
- **Release:** October 1st, 2024
